### YERI TIETE

##### CAPTAIN

Yeri Tiete, system engineer and chairman of [iRail](http://hello.iRail.be) - the NPO supporting digital creativity concerning transport - left [Google](https://www.google.com/about/jobs/locations/saint-ghislain) to dedicate himself entirely to FlatTurtle. 
With no mobile application available for public transport while Yeri was a student, he decided to build one himself and share it with others, for free, thereby causing great havoc (& fun) becoming subject of a discussion in the Flemish parliament.
