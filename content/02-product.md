### Provide your visitors with real-time updates from outside 

We use digital signage to keep the world informed. Thanks to the internet, our FlatTurtle displays are able to present **accurate, fully up-to-date information** for any particular location. And no matter how many FlatTurtle screens you have, you can control them separately. This means certain information on one screen, and different information on another. **Itâ€™s your choice**.
