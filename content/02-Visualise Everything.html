	<p>FlatTurtle has been developing an advanced <strong>technology<strong/> that "retrieves"
	any data and “visualises” this instantly on any display.<br />
	
	<br>
	
	<p>FlatTurtle <strong>visualises everything<strong/>: live road traffic, 
	live train schedules with walking distances (and delays), 
	live airport departure times, images, video, rss feeds, 
	emergency or service announcements, live local news, today's restaurant menu, 
	the weather in 6 minutes, real-time energy consumption,
	wayfinding, building directory, upcoming events, shared meetingroom or 
	seminar calendars .. you name it. Our Clients visualise absolutely 
	everything with their FlatTurtle.<br />

	<br>
	
	<p>FlatTurtle visualises <strong>on any display<strong/>; <br />
	on "yours" - a hard-to-miss professional Hi-Def LED flatscreen installed in your 
	entrance hall, parking, elevator.. - <br />
	or "theirs" - the welcoming page on your visitors smartphone.<br />

	<br>
	
	<p>And you stay in full control: connect our TurtleBox with a simple HDMI-cable to your display 
	and to the internet and your FlatTurtle is up and running. Log in via the internet to your private
	<a href="https://my.flatturtle.com/" target="_blank">my.FlatTurtle.com</a> account 
	and <strong>manage your display(s) remotely<strong/>, from anywhere, from any device connected to 
	the internet.<br />
	<p>Our team is really strong in Open Data so we've not stopped developing Open Source easy-to-use "Turtles" 
	generating automated fresh content you can slide in and <strong>build your own<strong/> display, 
	in your look & feel. (For example, there's a TrainTurtle, TrafficTurtle, a WeatherTurtle, an ImageTurtle, a VideoTurtle, 
	a CalendarTurtle, a MenuTurtle, a DirectoryTurtle, a MeetingRoomTurtle, .. you name it,
	all converting big data into instant knowledge, every single second, for our 
	growning list of satisfied Clients.)</p>
