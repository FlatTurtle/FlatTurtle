<h1>How FlatTurtle works</h1>
<h2>FlatTurtle visualises information</h2>
<h3>about your location on flat screen displays</h3>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	<p>whether these are installed in your entrance hall, restaurant or even your elevator. </p>
	<p>Add a sophisticated building directory, display a map of the local area, share live traffic information, provide half hourly weather updates and even leave welcoming messages for your visitors. These are just a few of the possibilities FlatTurtle can offer.</p>

<h1>What can I display?</h1>
<h2>Everything.</h2>
<h3> In real-time.</h3>

<div class="row">
