Time Line
=========

1492 - The World is Round
-------------------------

Christopher Columbus sets sail for India, going west. He had 3 ships, never found India, called the people he met “Indians” and came home to report to his king & queen: "**The world is round**."

2005 - The World is Flat
------------------------

512 years later, Thomas Friedman sets off for India, going east. He had Lufthansa business class and came home to report to his wife : "**The world is flat**."

09/2008 - First mobile iPhone app
---------------------------------

Setting off to college by train everyday, young & handsome (especially young) student Yeri Tiete keeps on missing out on some of his more interesting courses due to frequent delays of his train. Equipped with his iPhone, Yeri gets all inspired for the summer... he posts "Wouldn't it be cool if we had some open API, where we could submit departure station, arrival." With no iPhone compatible website or application around, Yeri - always late for college - develops and shares his own "railroute planner" for every iPhone user on this planet: "[iRail.be](http://irail.be) a mobile platform available to serve the mobile traveller".

06/2010 - Example followed... And sued
--------------------------------------

1,5 years later, the Belgian railway operator finally launches their own mobile application and threatens Yeri with a lawsuit running the free iRail.be website. Belgium is somewhat shocked by this reaction and under huge media attention, young student Yeri and his iRail.be got 10.672 views in just 3 days, sparking many young enthusiasts from all over the country, such as Pieter Colpaert, to support and share Yeri's initiative.

01/2011 - Community driven development: iRail
---------------------------------------------

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-9">
The lawsuit, meanwhile being discussed in the Flemish Parlaiment, inspires a whole bunch of digital creatives to group under the [iRail Not for Profit Organisation](http://hello.iRail.be) as an ever growing community open for students, developers & enthusiasts. iRail is currently part of the even larger [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.be) and aims to support digital creativity with a touch of mobility and open data.

02/2011 - FlatTurtle is born in a Flat World
--------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, corporate real estate professional Christophe Petitjean grassroots ways displaying public transport information to/from longterm vacant offices, making them more attractive to potential occupants. He doesn't find the tool, but he does find the data and the team: iRail.be. After numerous beers, **FlatTurtle is born**.

02/2012 - First stable prototype for UBS, Codic and Banimmo
-----------------------------------------------------------

After beta-testing a first prototype for real estate investor [Allianz](http://www.allianz.com/), FlatTurtle launches a stable "beta" for [Codic](http://www.codic.eu) and [UBS Investment Bank](http://www.ubs.com/be/en.html) (ps: UBS Investment Bank is **the second largest asset manager** on this planet). A bit later, pan-European real estate company [Banimmo](http://www.banimmo.com) boosts visibility ordering a FlatTurtle in each one of their properties, getting the scoop of several new features.

09/2013 - Digital signage with a real-time twist
------------------------------------------------

Mobility is great. Especially in these times. But at FlatTurtle we think the sky is the limit so we transform our platform in an open real-time communication tool. FlatTurtle starts extra's by offering WiFi, managed shared meeting rooms, with hundreds of displays; all this via it's open and modular backend.
