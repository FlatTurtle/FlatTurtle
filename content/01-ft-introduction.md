## Real-time

Real-time means real-time. It's live. FlatTurtle doesn't pull new information every few minutes; we push directly whenever we get newly, updated info.

## Cloud

Except for the embedded device that controls your display, all of our services are cloud-based. So all you need is a simple internet connection and you're ready to go. This also means no hidden fees, no expensive licenses, no servers to manage. Oh, and that one device on premises, is entirely managed and updated by us. For you, that means it's plug & play.
